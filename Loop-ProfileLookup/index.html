    <h2>Build a Profile Lookup</h2>
    <p>
      In this lab, you will build a profile lookup that looks up information
      about people in a contacts list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete
      the lab.
    </p>
    <ol>
      User Stories:
      <li>
        You should create a function named lookUpProfile that takes a name and a
        property as arguments.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should retrieve contact information from the provided contacts
        array.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the function receives a contact name and the property exists on the
        related contact, then the property's value should be returned.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the name passed to the function does not match any contacts in the
        contacts array, then the function should return "No such contact".
      </li>
      <li>
        If the property does not exist on a found contact, then the function
        should return "No such property".
      </li>
