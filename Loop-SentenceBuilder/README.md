# Sentence Analyzer

Step 1
In this workshop, you will build a sentence analyzer that will take a sentence and get the count for the number of words, vowels, consonants, and punctuation marks.

To begin, create a getVowelCount function with a parameter called sentence. Your function should return the total number of vowels in a sentence.

Step 2
Now it is time to test your getVowelCount function.

Create a vowelCount variable and assign it the result of calling the getVowelCount function with the argument of "Apples are tasty fruits"

After that, log the following to the console: "Vowel Count: [vowel count goes here]". Replace [vowel count goes here] with the actual variable name. You can choose to use template strings or string concatenation with the + operator here
