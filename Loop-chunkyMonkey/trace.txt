🔁 Loop 1:

i = 0

Expression → arr.slice(0, 0 + 2) → arr.slice(0, 2)

It takes elements from index 0 up to (but not including) index 2
→ ["a", "b"]

Push into result → [["a", "b"]]

Loop 2:

i = 2
Expression → arr.slice(2, 2 + 2) → arr.slice(2, 4)
Takes elements from index 2 up to (but not including) 4
→ ["c", "d"]
Push into result → [["a", "b"], ["c", "d"]]

i = 4
Expression → arr.slice(4, 4 + 2) → arr.slice(4, 6)
Takes elements from index 4 up to (but not including) 6
→ only "e" exists → ["e"]
Push into result → [["a", "b"], ["c", "d"], ["e"]]
